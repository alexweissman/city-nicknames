# City Nicknames
A collection of informal, unofficial, slang, and historical names for the largest cities worldwide (and a few countries, too!)  Implemented as a simple JSON mapping of nicknames to proper names.

Compiled from Wikipedia, Twitter, and personal experience.  Some nicknames are ambiguous, and have been used to refer to more than one city.  For example, "Pearl of the Orient" has been used to refer to Shanghai, Hong Kong, and the Phillipines.  In this case, we omit the nickname entirely from the list.  This is done to avoid the need for contextual disambiguation, for example in natural language processing tasks, etc.
